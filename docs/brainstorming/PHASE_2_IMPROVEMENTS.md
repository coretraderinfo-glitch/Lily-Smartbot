# Phase 2: Refinement & World-Class Improvements
*Brainstorming Session - Started on 2026-02-05*

## Guiding Principles
1.  **Visual Excellence**: Move beyond basic text; use formatted layouts, emojis, and web views.
2.  **Strict Auditability**: Every action must be traceable.
3.  **User Experience (UX)**: "Don't make me think" philosophy for operators.

## User Requested Improvements
*(Waiting for user input...)*

## Potential Areas for Discussion
1.  **Bill Visualization**:
    - Current: Simple Text.
    - Proposed: HTML/Canvas generated image or a sleek Web Dashboard link.
2.  **Command Flow**:
    - Are the commands `+100` / `下发` too manual? Do we need buttons?
3.  **Admin Control panels**:
    - Web-based settings management?
4.  **Notifications**:
    - Alerts for large transactions?
